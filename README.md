I began my coding journey back in middle school and high school with small, static HTML pages. Since then, I have expanded my coding expertise with the help of App Academy and their 6 month online coding boot camp. While studying with App Academy, I learned to code with Javascript, React/Redux, SQL, SQlite3, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Docker, and used Git for version control and paired programming. The projects I developed have all used Git and Github, as well as being deployed on Heroku or Render. While learning at App Academy, I studied Test Driven Development (TDD), Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and Data Structures & Algorithms (DS&A), which have helped me become a well-rounded programmer. Since graduating in December 2022, I have continued to study Data Structures and Algorithms, learned Typescript on my own, have been working on a contract with Meta improving my skills in Python, Pandas, SQL, and RegEx through mentorship, and volunteered to make a website for a LGBTQ+ nonprofit in South Africa. 

Before becoming a coder, I was an A/V Technician for 6 years at Alaska Universal Productions (AUP), a live event production company in Fairbanks, Alaska. While there, I set up, operated, and dismantled lighting, audio, stage, and video equipment for live events and installations. I was also an arena rigger for events that needed things to be suspended above the floor. At AUP, I was also able to be a production assistant and grip for a few commercial and film productions. I'm proud of the installations that I was able to do there, both in home and in businesses, as well as the skills I learned in lighting and sound design, arena rigging, interpersonal interactions, and customer service.

In my free time, I enjoy skydiving, hiking, snowboarding, rock climbing and playing video games/ board games. The physical, mental, and sometimes challenging nature of these activities keeps me engaged and constantly learning new techniques and skills, similar to how coding and my previous work experience has been. I am proud to be part of the LGBTQ+ community and passionate about climate change.
